CometCommand
============
This is the source code fot my game Comet Command. It is written in Java using the Libgdx framework and Box2d physics engine. 
It uses the latest version of Libgdx, including the Gradle build system. So it should be easy to import 

I'm not sure why the old projects named AsteroidCommand* wont go away, still figuring out git.
