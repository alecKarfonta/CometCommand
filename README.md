CometCommand
============
This is the source code for my game Comet Command. It is written in Java using the Libgdx framework and Box2d physics engine. 
It uses the latest version of Libgdx, including the Gradle build system. So it should be easy to import 

If anyone feels like adding a feature to the app on Google Play, email me and I will push your branch. 


I'm not sure why the old projects named AsteroidCommand* wont go away, still figuring out git.
